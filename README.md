# Commonsense Knowledge-Base Project

This repository contains resources and tools for building a **commonsense knowledge-base**, along with methods for **retriever fine-tuning** and **manual annotation**.  
The goal is to improve the retrieval and reasoning capabilities of downstream NLP applications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Additionally, download NLTK WordNet data:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('wordnet')
```

## Creating a Commonsense Knowledge-Base
- Collect raw textual resources (e.g., Wikipedia, scientific articles, QA datasets).
- Normalize and preprocess text (tokenization, cleaning, deduplication).
- Extract candidate commonsense triples or statements using automated methods (e.g., dependency parsing, information extraction).
- Store in a structured format (JSON, CSV, or a graph database) for easy querying.

**Example pipeline:**
1. Data collection → 2. Text preprocessing → 3. Knowledge extraction → 4. Storage & indexing

## Retriever Fine-tuning
- Use the knowledge-base to fine-tune a retriever model (e.g., DPR, ColBERT).
- Optimize retrieval quality on commonsense-focused benchmarks.
- Evaluate using metrics such as Recall@k, MRR, and nDCG.

**Steps:**
1. Prepare positive (relevant) and negative (irrelevant) pairs.
2. Fine-tune with contrastive learning or other retrieval objectives.
3. Evaluate and iterate.

## Manual Annotation
- For high-quality supervision, human annotators review and label candidate knowledge.
- Focus on:
  - Filtering out noisy or non-commonsense statements.
  - Validating entity relations.
  - Creating gold-standard evaluation datasets.

**Tips for annotation:**
- Provide clear labeling guidelines to annotators.
- Use annotation tools (e.g., Prodigy, Label Studio).
- Periodically measure inter-annotator agreement (IAA) to ensure consistency.
