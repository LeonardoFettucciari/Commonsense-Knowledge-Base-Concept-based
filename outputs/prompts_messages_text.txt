Choices:
A. the dog enjoys being washed out
B. washing all the fur is easy
C. it takes hours to vacuum all of the fur
D. the fur is still attached to the skin

Reasoning:
Let's think step by step. We need to find what the problem is when a Husky sheds. The dog may or may not enjoy being washed out, this does not seem to be a consistent side effect of when the dog sheds. A Husky is a dog with a lot of fur. So it can' t be easy to wash it all. It is true that it would take a long time to vacuum all of the fur. Fur still attached to the skin may happen, but it is not a direct side effect of when the dog sheds, but somethinf that may happen.

Reasoning:
A bycicle is a vehicle. However no choice talks about using it for reaching places. In case of rain bycicles are not usually used. Cats or elephants are animals and bycicles are not used for animals. Thinking about the actual mechanism of a bycicle, we can infer that it may be used for a different purpouse from the original one and that is using the pedals movement for grinding coffee.

Reasoning:
Freezing point is best represented by ice, since all other options represent the liquid state of water, whereas ice sculpture represents the solid state of water which is indeed ice.

Shedding is a natural process where animals lose old fur and grow new fur.
Shedding is a natural process where animals lose old fur and grow new fur.
Fur can be shed seasonally, with animals growing thicker fur in winter and shedding it in summer.
Shedding can be a natural process or a result of damage or disease.
Loss of a tail can impact an animal's ability to maintain balance and perform certain functions.
Damage to an animal's coat, such as cuts or parasites, can indicate underlying health problems.
Shedding is a natural process for many animals.
Fur can be shed seasonally, allowing animals to adapt to changing temperatures.
Shedding usually involves the removal of an outer layer or covering.

Knowledge:
Different substances have different freezing points.
The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius or 32 degrees Fahrenheit.
The boiling and freezing points of water can be affected by factors like pressure and the presence of dissolved substances.
Zero degrees Celsius is the freezing point of water.
Water freezes at 0 degrees centigrade and boils at 100 degrees centigrade at standard atmospheric pressure.
Different substances freeze at different temperatures.
Ice is formed when water freezes below 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit).
The extent of freezing's effectiveness depends on the temperature and duration of exposure.
The melting point of a substance is the temperature at which it changes from solid to liquid.
The freezing point of a liquid can be lowered by adding solutes.
