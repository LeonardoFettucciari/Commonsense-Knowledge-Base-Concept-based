Reasoning:
Let's think step by step. We need to find what the problem is when a Husky sheds. The dog may or may not enjoy being washed out, this does not seem to be a consistent side effect of when the dog sheds. A Husky is a dog with a lot of fur. So it can' t be easy to wash it all. It is true that it would take a long time to vacuum all of the fur. Fur still attached to the skin may happen, but it is not a direct side effect of when the dog sheds, but somethinf that may happen.

Reasoning:
A bycicle is a vehicle. However no choice talks about using it for reaching places. In case of rain bycicles are not usually used. Cats or elephants are animals and bycicles are not used for animals. Thinking about the actual mechanism of a bycicle, we can infer that it may be used for a different purpouse from the original one and that is using the pedals movement for grinding coffee.
