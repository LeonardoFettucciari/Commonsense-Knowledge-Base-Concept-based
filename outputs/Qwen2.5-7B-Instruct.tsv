Precise timing is crucial for many actions; a slight delay or advance can significantly alter the outcome, sometimes with disastrous consequences (e.g., a poorly timed surgical incision, a missed deadline).
Precise timing is crucial for many actions; a slight delay or advance can significantly alter the outcome, sometimes with disastrous consequences (e.g., a poorly timed surgical incision, a missed deadline).
Advancing a deadline might require extra effort and coordination with others involved in the project to ensure timely completion.
Advancing a deadline often requires extra effort and may not always be feasible, depending on the task's complexity and available resources.
The assigned time for an activity should account for potential unforeseen delays or complications to ensure sufficient time for completion.
The assigned time for an activity should account for potential unforeseen delays or complications to ensure sufficient time for completion.
Construction timelines and budgets are frequently impacted by unforeseen circumstances, such as weather delays, material shortages, or changes in design specifications.  Contingency planning and flexible management are essential for mitigating these risks.
Advancing a deadline might require extra effort and possibly compromise on some aspects of the project to meet the new, earlier date.
Time is a finite resource; once spent, it cannot be recovered, so prioritize tasks and avoid wasting it on unproductive activities."	B	B	B	B	B	B	B	B	B	B	B

The provided definition of ""sport"" is incorrect.  The definition describes someone with good sportsmanship, not the concept of ""sport"" itself.  A sport is an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment.
The level of physical fitness required varies greatly depending on the specific sport; some sports demand high endurance, while others prioritize strength or agility.
Most sports involve some degree of physical activity and require skill development through practice.
In sports, fielding a ball successfully often depends on factors beyond just skill, such as the ball's trajectory, the player's positioning, and even environmental conditions like wind or terrain.
Professional athletes in a sport typically have specialized skills and undergo rigorous training regimes.

The concept of ""home"" often implies a sense of belonging, security, and nurture, regardless of the physical structure involved.  A person might feel more at home in a supportive community than in a luxurious but isolating mansion.
While a home is often a physical place, the feeling of ""home"" can be associated with people, memories, and even abstract concepts like a sense of community or belonging.
Different types of homes exist (e.g., family homes, nursing homes, group homes) each with varying levels of care and support tailored to the specific needs of their residents.

The Alabama River is navigable for a significant portion of its length, facilitating commercial transport and recreational boating.
Cars that move passengers significantly ""up"" are likely elevators or funiculars, not typical road vehicles.
The experience of ""up and down"" movement in a car can be affected by factors like road conditions and the car's suspension system.
Access to and from the car is likely to be challenging, requiring specialized equipment or procedures due to the car's elevated position and the potential for movement during ascent and descent.
Something described as ""new"" is generally understood to be of recent origin, typically within the last few decades or less, depending on the context.  A ""new"" car is different from a ""new"" historical theory.
Alabama's location on the Gulf Coast significantly impacts its economy, leading to industries like fishing, shipping, and tourism.

B. world
C. protection
D. colorado
E. america"	"In literature and art, an eagle's image is frequently used to symbolize strength, majesty, and leadership, often associated with a heroic or dominant figure.
Because of their size and hunting prowess, eagles are apex predators in their respective ecosystems, playing a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance.
Achieving an eagle is considered a significant accomplishment in golf, demonstrating exceptional skill and precision.
Seeing an eagle depicted on a nation's flag or official seal often suggests a powerful and proud nation.
An eagle is a highly desirable outcome in golf, indicating exceptional skill and accuracy on a single hole.

The rarity of eagles makes them significant achievements, often celebrated by golfers and remembered in their scorecards.
An eagle is a rare and impressive feat in golf, signifying exceptional skill and precision on a single hole.

B. waiting
C. hair
D. time
E. patience"	"Waiting in line for a popular ride, especially during peak hours, is a common occurrence at amusement parks and other locations with rides.
To advance in a queue typically requires waiting for those ahead of you to proceed.
Rides at amusement parks often have height restrictions, meaning individuals shorter than a certain height may not be allowed to ride.
Because a queue is concentrated at the back of the head, it might be less practical for activities involving frequent head movement or requiring a helmet, as it could be uncomfortable or easily dislodged.
Queues typically form when there is a limited resource or service, such as a cashier at a store or a toll booth on a highway.
People typically line up when there's a limited resource or service, such as buying tickets, boarding a plane, or ordering food, to ensure fairness and order.
A ride typically implies movement from one place to another, whether it's a short distance or a long journey.
A queue hairstyle is typically longer and requires regular maintenance, such as brushing and potentially braiding or tying to keep it neat.
Long queues often indicate high demand or a bottleneck in the system, potentially suggesting a need for improved efficiency or additional resources.

B. ladder
C. natural history museum
D. cherry tree
E. chicken coop"	"Weasels often operate behind the scenes, making it difficult to pinpoint their deceitful actions until the damage is done.
While a weasel might initially appear charming or helpful, their true intentions are usually manipulative and self-interested.
Trusting a weasel can lead to significant betrayal and negative consequences, as their primary motivation is self-serving.
Because weasels are small and have many natural predators (like larger birds of prey and other mammals), they often rely on camouflage and quick movements to avoid being caught.  Their coloration often blends in with their environment.
Describing something as a ""hair's-breadth"" away from disaster implies a near-miss, where the outcome could have easily been catastrophic.
Weasels are predators, meaning they hunt and kill other animals for food, typically smaller rodents and rabbits.  Their long, slender bodies allow them to pursue prey into burrows and confined spaces.
While being first can be advantageous, it also carries increased pressure and scrutiny, as the leader is often the target of attention and criticism.
Weasels have a musky odor used for marking territory and attracting mates, but this scent can also be a deterrent to potential predators or competitors.  The strength of the scent can vary depending on the species and the individual weasel.
The definition of ""first"" is context-dependent; what constitutes ""first"" in one situation (e.g., first to arrive) might be irrelevant or differently defined in another (e.g., first in line of succession).
Something described as ""first"" often implies novelty, precedence, or a pioneering achievement in its field or category."	D	D	D	D	D	D	D	D	D	D	D
